<h3>
  <strong> Bio </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  I'm a passionate, hard working individual who enjoys learning and is always
  looking to improve my skills. I have worked in many fields, but it was my time
  spent working with Cleartalk, and Jackson Hewitt, that really set me on the
  path I'm on today. Through those experiences, I learned that I actually loved
  technology, and wanted to be apart of that world in some way. Such jobs often
  require a degree or simply don't exist in my area, so I got to work on getting
  that certificate! I am now going through the MIT xPro course, and will
  continue working diligently on my studies until I achieve my goal.

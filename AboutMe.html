  <strong> Bio </strong>
</h3>
    <P>
      I'm a passionate, hard working individual who enjoys learning and is always looking to improve my skills. I have worked in many fields, but it was my time spent working with Cleartalk, and Jackson Hewitt, that really set me on the path I'm on today. Through those experiences, I learned that I actually loved technology, and wanted to be apart of that world in some way. Such jobs often require a degree or simply don't exist in my area, so I got to work on getting that certificate! I am now going through the MIT xPro course, and will continue working diligently on my studies until I achieve my goal.

      This is a simulator that creates endless PacMen running around the screen.
      As many PackMen as clicks of the generator button. I wonder if you could
      fill the entire screen....

      This is literally googly eyes, but make it creepy. No, it's not your
      imagination. It is following you. Yes it's unnerving, but fairly harmless.
      Except maybe to your sanity.

      They tell me this is supposed to track the bus going from Harvard to MIT,
      but I've been waiting for ages and I'm starting to wonder if it's lying to
      me.
